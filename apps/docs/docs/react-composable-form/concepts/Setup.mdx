Before we can start creating forms we'll need to set up a few things, some of which are optional but are outlined here for reference.

The main concept of `react-composable-form` is to construct `React` components using a `createForm` function and a configuration:

```tsx
const MyForm = createForm(yourConfigurationHere);
```

However, there is actually no `createForm` function exported from the package. Instead, you'll make a specific function for your project.

> The benefits of this will be explained in more detail later in this guide.

## Simple setup

Create a new file anywhere in your project containing the following:

```tsx
import { createRCF } from "react-composable-form";

export const createForm = createRCF();
```

You can now import this `createForm` function anywhere in your project and use it to create forms.

Proceed to the rest of the documentation to learn how to use it.

> This is the simplest setup you can have, and is what javascript users will use.

## Advanced setup

This section is only relevant for typescript users.

### Shared field component properties

Providing a generic type to `createForm` will make sure that all field components that you assign to a form accepts these props.

```tsx
import { createRCF } from "react-composable-form";

export const createForm = createRCF<SharedFieldProps>();

interface SharedFieldProps {
  isLoading?: boolean;
  label?: ReactNode;
}
```

### Typesafe field and layout component props

Later on in this guide, you'll learn how to create your own field and layout components.

When you do, you'll need to define the props that they accept. Here's how you define this types:

```tsx
import type { inferFieldProps, inferLayoutProps } from "react-composable-form";

export type FieldProps<Value> = inferFieldProps<typeof createForm, Value>;

export type FormLayoutProps = inferLayoutProps<typeof createForm>;
```
