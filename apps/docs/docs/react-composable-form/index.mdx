# Overview

## Motivation

Most form libraries for React does one thing really well: State management.
However, when working with forms at scale, that is often not enough.

Things like reusing existing forms, but with a different layout, or enforcing conventions
like shared props for all fields (i.e. a size option), often remains entirely up to the developer.

[Here are a few examples with common form libraries that come short when used at scale](motivation-examples).

That's why React Composable Form has first class support for not only [state management](concepts/state-management),
but also [composition](concepts/composition) and [convention](concepts/convention).

## Quick Start

React Composable Form is a _configuration first_ form library.
You create your forms using a factory that returns a React component.

Here's a comprehensive example to give you an idea of what it looks like:

> See the [high level concepts](concepts) for a more detailed breakdown.

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  {codeElements}
  <UserForm />
</Split>
