# Overview

> Heads up! React Composable Form is in beta and is subject to breaking changes,
> and likewise this documentation is under construction and will have missing content and contain inaccuracies.

## Motivation

Most form libraries for React does one thing really well: state management. However, that is often not enough.

Even with form state management handled for you, you usually end up having to solve things like this on your own:

- Reusing forms with a different layout
- Reusing forms with a subset or superset of fields
- Consistently using specific field components to represent certain data types
- Enforcing a convention of props that can be used in all field components and layouts (i.e. a size option)

These type of things are really hard to get right and can easily end up with a lot of complex boilerplate code, especially when you want it to be typesafe.

React Composable Form aims to solve these problems by providing a composable, typesafe, configuration first form library.

## Quick Start

You create your forms using a factory that returns a `React` component.

Here's a comprehensive example to give you an idea of its capabilities, and what it looks like:

> See the [guide](/docs/category/guide) for a detailed walkthrough of the library.

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  <CodeBlock language="tsx">{code.UserForm}</CodeBlock>
  <component.UserForm />
</Split>
