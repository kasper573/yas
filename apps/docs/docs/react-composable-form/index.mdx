# Overview

> Heads up! The React Composable Form library is in beta and is subject to breaking changes,
> and likewise this documentation is under construction and will have missing content and contain inaccuracies.

## Motivation

Most form libraries for React does one thing really well: state management.
However, at scale, that is often not enough.

Things like reusing forms with a different layout, reusing forms with a subset of its fields, enforcing conventions
like consistent use of components per field data type, or allowing shared props for all fields (i.e. a size option),
often remains entirely up to the developer to solve on their own.

These things are hard to get right and require a lot of boilerplate code, especially when you want it to be typesafe.

That's why React Composable Form has first class support for not only state management,
but also composition and conventions.

## Quick Start

React Composable Form is a _configuration first_ form library.
You create your forms using a factory that returns a React component.

Here's a comprehensive example to give you an idea of what it looks like:

> See the [high level concepts](/docs/category/concepts) for a more detailed breakdown.

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  {codeElements}
  <UserForm />
</Split>
