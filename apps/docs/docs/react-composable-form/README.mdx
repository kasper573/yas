# react-composable-form

## Factory

react-composable-form is a *configuration first* form library. You create your forms using a factory:

```jsx
import {createForm} from "react-composable-form";

const Form = createForm();
```

# Type Mappings

At the core of react-composable-form is `type mapping`, associating field components with runtime available types:

```jsx
import {createForm} from "react-composable-form";

const MyForm = createForm((options) =>
  options
    // TextField, NumberField and SwitchField are all react components.
    // Ignore where they come from for now, we'll explain how to create them later.
    .type(z.string(), TextField)
    .type(z.number(), NumberField)
    .type(z.boolean(), SwitchField),
);
```
