Layouts are responsible for styling and plotting out a forms fields and actions (i.e. submit and reset buttons).

It's also possible to reuse an existing form to create a composition with a new layout.

## Forms have no layout by default

Consider this form where we define a schema and a few field components, but you've provided no layout.

By default there's no layout at all, so when you render the form, nothing but the fields will be rendered in the order they were defined.

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  <CodeBlock language="tsx">{code.LoginForm}</CodeBlock>
  <component.LoginForm />
</Split>

## Assigning a layout

Before we get into [how to define a layout component](#how-to-define-a-layout-component), it's useful to first understand how they are used and what effect they have.

In this example we have provided you with a layout called `CardLayout`. Let's extend the form we just created with this layout:

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  <div>
    <CodeBlock language="tsx">{code.CardLoginForm}</CodeBlock>
    Observe how the fields are now rendered inside a card with a submit and reset
    button.
  </div>
  <component.CardLoginForm />
</Split>

## Compose as much as you like

Thanks to the `extend` function you can create as many compositions as you like.

Here's the same form as before, but now with a layout that renders the fields in a row and only has a submit button.

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  <CodeBlock language="tsx">{code.InlineLoginForm}</CodeBlock>
  <component.InlineLoginForm />
</Split>

## How to define a layout component

Here's how the `CardLayout` component from the previous example was defined:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{code.CardLayout}</CodeBlock>

### For Typescript users

If you're using Typescript, you're probably wondering where the `FromLayoutProps` type comes from.

You define it in your setup file. Here's a minimal example:

```tsx
import { createRCF, inferLayoutProps } from "react-composable-form";

export const createForm = createRCF();

export type FormLayoutProps = inferLayoutProps<typeof createForm>;
```

The reason for this inference approach is to allow your layout components to be aware of any custom type information provided to your `createForm` factory, for example:

```tsx
interface SharedFieldProps {
  isLoading?: boolean;
  label?: ReactNode;
}

export const createForm = createRCF<SharedFieldProps>();

export type FormLayoutProps = inferLayoutProps<typeof createForm>;
```

`FormLayoutProps` will now be aware that the fields have the `isLoading` and `label` props, so you can even use them in your generic layout components!

## Specialized layout components

We can also create a layout components that are specific to a particular form by passing in an inline function as the layout component.

This allows Typescript to infer type information about the forms fields, which allows us to be more specific about the layout.

<Split names={["Code", "Form"]}>
  <CodeBlock language="tsx">{code.SpecializedLoginForm}</CodeBlock>
  <component.SpecializedLoginForm />
</Split>
